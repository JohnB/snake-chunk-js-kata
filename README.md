A step-by-step guide to making a javascript snake game with CHUNK.js

## Prerequisites

This kata assumes you:

1. Are on a mac (for now!)
1. Have [installed git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
2. Have installed [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and enabled the
   [command line tools](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html)
3. Have enabled the web developer tools in
   [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console),
   [Safari](http://superuser.com/questions/302014/safari-web-developer-tools#302016)
   or [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console)
4. Are willing to open a terminal.

## Running the Kata

To walk through the kata, open a terminal and run the following commands:

    cd ~/Desktop           # Change the terminals working directory to your
                           #  Desktop
    git clone https://github.com/zspencer/snake-chunk-js-kata.git
                           # Download the code for the kata from github
    cd snake-chunk-js-kata # Change the terminals working directory to the
                           #  directory containing the code
    open snake.html        # Open the game in your browser
    bin/rewind             # Go to the beginning of the kata
    subl .                 # Open the code in the Sublime text editor

Once you've read the code and are ready to move to the next step, go back to
your terminal and run `bin/next`. Refresh the page in your browser to see the
code run! (Sublime will automatically update the code).
